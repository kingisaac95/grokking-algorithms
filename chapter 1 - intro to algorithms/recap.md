# Chapter 1 - Recap

- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gest a lot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows.
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.
