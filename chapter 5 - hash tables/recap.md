- Hash tables are good for modeling relationships from one item to another item.
- Once your load factor<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> is greater than 0.7, it's time to resize your hash table.
- Hash tables are used for caching data (for example, with a web server).
- Hash tables are great for catching duplicates.
